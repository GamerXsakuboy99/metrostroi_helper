# Metrostroi Helper

Metrostroi helper is a add-on what shows RK level of rheostat trains and power lever position.
this add on is very helpful for new players of metrostroi and even for veterans if they are bit lazy to read amps counts :D

## How to use?

shift + ecs to open console and write command:
metrostroi_helper 1

If you are seated in train already, leave the seat and re-seat and it should come on.
This works in other seats too in the cab, so it's useful for Instructors when teaching new drivers to drive on Rheostat based trains.

## Known issue
* Helper freezes up ones awhile. it will start working again at random moment.
* 81-540.1 gives error when sit. just resit to the seat.

### Server owners
Note that this mod only works for rheostat trains, so it will not work on trains what use other means of power control than rheostat.

#### More trains?
New trains will be added if they are rheostat controlled.
